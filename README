====  I. Getting The Source Code ===================

The IEGenLib library is being actively developed, and new functionalities
are being added. You can get the latest source code from this git repository:

    git clone https://github.com/CompOpt4Apps/IEGenLib


==== II. Quick Start ===============

  A. Building IEGenLib
  B. Simplifying constraints set containing Uninterpreted Function Calls
  C. Using the IEGenLib Python Interface

---- A. Building IEGenLib ----------

If you want to do a quick build, just run:
    ./configure
    make
    make test
 
If you want to do a quick build and install with python binding enabled, run:

    ./configure --build-python
    make
    make test
    make install

This will install into a directory IEGenLib/iegenlib
Set IEGEN_HOME to /full/path/to/IEGenLib/iegen

Please note there are requirements for python binding. These requirements and 
choosing an alternative installation directory is covered in the section IV.


---- B. Simplifying constraints set containing Uninterpreted Function Calls ---

One of the biggest functionalites currently implemented in IEGenLib is
simplifying sets of constraints containing uninterpreted function calls.
These sets can represent non-affine relations that result from
data dependence analysis of sparse matrix computation. The simplified sets
can be used for generating efficient inspectors in Inspector/Executor strategy.

After building IEGenLib library, this functionality can be used outside IEGenLib 
independently or get integrated into other libraries.
The driver file that shows how to do this, simplifyDriver.cc, is located
in home directory of IEGenLib, just next to this README file.
You can also have a look at the main test case for the functionality that is
located in the chillusage_test. There are also various test cases for 
sub-functionalities pertaining to simplification in the test cases.


---- C. Using the IEGenLib Python bindings ----------

Required to use Python bindings to IEGenLib:
    * Python 2.7.2 known to work on linux and Mac

The Python bindings shipped in the distribution ($IEGEN_HOME/bindings/..) 
can also be used to interface to the library.

    (1) Set the PYTHONPATH environment variable
    
     export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$IEGEN_HOME/bindings
            - OR -
     setenv PYTHONPATH $IEGEN_HOME/bindings


    (2) Run python
     
        python
        >>> import iegenlib

    (3) Examples
    The following Python statements are examples on how to create sets and 
    relations:

        >>> S1 = iegenlib.Set("{[s,i]: 0<=s && s<T && 0<=i && i<N}")
        >>> print S1
        
        >>> R1 = iegenlib.Relation("{[s,i]->[0,s,1,i,0]}")

    NOTE: Both the omega and ISL syntax are allowed for specifying sets and 
    relations.  Some of the short cuts such as 0<=i<N are missing however.
    
    The following Python statements are examples on how to apply operations 
    (such as Apply, Union, Inverse, and Compose) between sets/relations:
    
        >>> S2 = R1.Apply(S1)           # Apply operation  #
        
        >>> S3 = iegenlib.Set("{[i,j]: 0<=i and i<n and 5<=j and j<m}")
        
        >>> S4 = iegenlib.Set("{[i,j]: 0<=i and i<n and m+5<=j and j<m+10}")
        
        >>> S4 = S3.Union(S4)           # Union operation #
        
        >>> R2 = iegenlib.Relation("{[i,j]->[ip,jp]: ip=f(i) and jp=2j}")
        
        >>> R3 = iegenlib.Relation("{[q,r]->[i,j]: i=q and j=r}")
        
        >>> R3 = R3.Compose(R2)         # Compose operation#
        
        >>> R2 = R2.Inverse()           # Inverse operation#
        
        >>> print R2                    # to print the resulting set/relation#
            { [ip, jp] -> [i, j] : ip - f(i) = 0 && 2 j - jp = 0 } 
                                        # The output of the print command #

    Some examples that use function inverse declarations.
    
        # This indicates that the uninterpreted function f has the
        # given domain and range and is bijective.  Since is bijective
        # f_inv will be defined.
        >>> domain = iegenlib.Set("{[i]:0<=i &&i<G}")
        >>> range = iegenlib.Set("{[i]:0<=i &&i<G}")
        >>> fname = "f"
        >>> iegenlib.appendCurrEnv(fname,domain,range,True)

        >>> S5 = iegenlib.Set("{[i,j]:i=f(f_inv(j))}")
        >>> print "S5 = ", S5

        >>> R4 = iegenlib.Relation("{[i,j]->[ip,j]: ip=f(i)}")
        >>> print "R4 = ", R4

        >>> S6 = R4.Apply(S5)
        >>> print "S6 = ", S6


     The user can obtain dot files for SparseConstraints objects of
     sets/relations from the IEGenlib Python Interface by using
     toDotString() methods. Python methods open(filename, mode)  and
     write(item) can be used to open and write to the output file, as
     in the following examples:

        >>> S3 = iegenlib.Set("[n,m]->{[i,j]: 0<=i and i<n and 5<=j and j<m}")
         
        >>> file = open("S3.dot", 'w')
         
        >>> file.write(S3.toDotString())
         
        >>> file.close()


==== III. Distribution Organization ===============

The distribution is shipped as a tar file. When you unpack the tar
file it creates a directory that is the root of the distribution.

    tar xzvf iegenlib-#.#.#.tgz

Sources for the project are found in the distribution root src/
sub-directory.

The library and demonstration driver create both string and dot
output; graphviz is needed to visualize the dot output.
      

==== IV. Building IEGenLib from Source =======================

            * swig version 2.0.4 for linux, version 1.3.40 for Mac known to work
            ** please note: if installing swig from macports 2 packages 
               are required: swig and swig-python
 
        * If you plan to change the grammar for the sets or relations:
            * Flex: version 2.5.35 known to work
            * Bison: version 2.4.1 known to work

Please notify us if you find that other versions of these tools that
work or do not work for you.

Build files for the project are generated using cmake (except for the
distribution root-level Makefile that is included in the tar file).
Cmake version 2.6 or newer is required. Make files can be generated to
only build the binaries, to additionally generate the parser files,
and/or to additionally include Python bindings to the library. These
options are enabled through a configure script in the root of the
project. If the parser option is included, then additionally FLEX
version 2.5 or newer and BISON version 2.4 or newer are required. If
documentation is to be re-generated, then doxygen and dot are also
required to create it.

Run ./configure --help for more build configuration options.

The default install directory is ${IEGEN_DIR}/iegen/. This directory
may be changed using options to the configure script.  Note that the
cmake system places binaries in an iegen/ directory, rather than an
iegen-LINUX64/ or iegen-MacOSX/ directory as are shipped in the
distribution.


==== V. Running Tests =====

The iegen/bin/run_iegenlib_tests binary can be executed to run the tests of 
the various components of IEGenLib. Additionally, from the root of the 
distribution you can run 'make test' to run these same tests.

The gtest framework is used for writing and running unit tests.  Information 
on gtest can be found at:

    http://code.google.com/p/googletest/

and introductory documentation is at:

    http://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/V1_6_Primer

==== VI. Documentation =====

To create the doxygen documentation, run the following command:

    make docs

An index.html file will be created in the distribution root directory, in 
doc/html/. A latex pdf file, called refman.pdf will also be created, in the 
doc/latex/ directory. 

==== VII. Debug and Release Builds =====

The default build is the debug build.  It is set by cmake in the configure 
script with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug.  The compiler options for the 
debug build are '-O0 -g'.  

To create a release version, use in the -build--release option to the 
configure script. The compiler options for the release are '-O3 -DNDEBUG'.

To show actual build commands, you can run the verbose version of the build:
  
  make install VERBOSE=1
